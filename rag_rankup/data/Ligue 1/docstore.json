Administered by the Ligue de Football Professionnel, Ligue 1 is contested by 18 clubs (as of the 2023\u201324 season) and operates on a system of promotion and relegation from and to Ligue 2.\nSeasons run from August to May. Clubs play two matches against each of the other teams in the league \u2013 one home and one away \u2013 totalling to 34 matches over the course of the season. Most games are played on Saturdays and Sundays, with a few games played during weekday evenings. Play is regularly suspended the last weekend before Christmas for two weeks before returning in the second week of January. As of 2024, Ligue 1 is considered one of the top national leagues, ranked fifth in Europe, behind England's Premier League, Spain's La Liga, Italy's Serie A and Germany's Bundesliga.\nLigue 1 was inaugurated on 11 September 1932 under the name National before switching to Division 1 after a year of existence. It continued to operate under that name until 2002, when it adopted its current name. Paris Saint-Germain are the most successful club with twelve league titles, while Lyon is the club that has won the most consecutive titles (seven between 2002 and 2008). Saint-\u00c9tienne was the first club with ten titles. With the presence of 73 seasons in Ligue 1, Marseille holds the record for most seasons among the elite, while Paris Saint-Germain hold the league record for longevity with 50 consecutive seasons (from 1974 to present). Nantes is the team with the longest consecutive unbeaten streak (32 matches) and the fewest number of defeats (one match) in a single season, doing so in the 1994\u201395 campaign. In addition, Nantes also holds the record for the longest time without losing at home with a run of 92 matches from May 1976 to April 1981.\nThe current champions are Paris Saint-Germain, who won a record twelfth title in the 2023\u201324 season. The league has been won on multiple occasions by foreign-based club Monaco, the presence of which within the league makes it a cross-border competition.\nAhead of the 2023\u201324 season, the number of teams in the league was reduced to 18; four teams in the 2022\u201323 Ligue 1 were relegated to Ligue 2 and only two teams in Ligue 2 were promoted to Ligue 1.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nProfessionalism in French football did not exist until July 1930, when the National Council of the French Football Federation voted 128\u201320 in favour of its adoption. The founders of professionalism in French football are Georges Bayrou, Emmanuel Gambardella, and Gabriel Hanot. Professionalism was officially implemented in 1932.\nIn order to successfully create a professional football league in the country, the Federation limited the league to twenty clubs. In order to participate in the competition, clubs were subjected to three important criteria:\n\nThe incoming club must have had positive results in the past.\nThe incoming club must be able to pull in enough revenue to balance its finances.\nThe incoming club must be able to successfully recruit at least eight professional players.\nMany clubs disagreed with the subjective criteria, most notably Strasbourg, RC Roubaix, Amiens and Stade Fran\u00e7ais, while others like Rennes, due to fear of bankruptcy, and Lille, due to a conflict of interest, were reluctant to become professional. Lille's president, Henri Jooris, also chairman of the Ligue du Nord, feared his league would fold and proposed it become the second division of the new league. Eventually, many clubs earned professional status, though it became more difficult to convince clubs in the northern half of the country; Strasbourg, Roubaix and Amiens refused to accept the new league, while conversely Mulhouse, Excelsior AC Roubaix, Metz and Fives accepted professionalism. In southern France, clubs such as Marseille, Hy\u00e8res, Montpellier, N\u00eemes, Cannes, Antibes and Nice were extremely supportive of the new league and accepted their professional status without argument.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4108, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6915a8c8-8de6-493c-b1ec-755f7279865a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6915a8c8-8de6-493c-b1ec-755f7279865a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Ligue 1.txt", "file_name": "Ligue 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d5c188ac-6407-4424-8fe6-83cd67dab4f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Ligue 1.txt", "file_name": "Ligue 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "b16fd4e1db4250ba16b1fbc85e364576ca4fa5d813831095313f650fce26b03c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5154f464-8510-4bb7-a6a9-ccbe39a7713f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Ligue 1.txt", "file_name": "Ligue 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "6aa4613b6bfc88856b8d303606db39ce39ea8d292eb2e693c3b5f46e0f1168dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "56c63624-f75e-4d55-994b-c34d295844f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d1833826e23d8b4a478e6f4161d11a6becf7b8a39a267c11ed82988c9dcdb3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Establishment ===\n\nThe league's inaugural season of the all-professional league, called National, was held in 1932\u20131933. The 20 inaugural members of National were Antibes, CA Paris, Cannes, Club Fran\u00e7ais, Excelsior AC Roubaix, Fives, Hy\u00e8res, Marseille, Metz, Mulhouse, Nice, N\u00eemes, Al\u00e8s, Lille, Racing Club de France, Red Star Olympique, Rennes, Sochaux, S\u00e8te and Montpellier. The 20 clubs were inserted into two groups of 10 with the bottom three of each group suffering relegation to Division 2. The two winners of each group would then face each other in a final held at a neutral venue, which later turned out to the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir. The first final was held on 14 May 1933 and it matched the winner of Group A, Olympique Lillois, against the runner-up of Group B, Cannes. Antibes, the winner of Group B, was supposed to take part in the final but was suspected of bribery by the French Football Federation and was disqualified. In the first final, Lillois were crowned the inaugural champions following the club's 4\u20133 victory. After the season, the league decided to retain the 14 clubs and not promote any sides from the second division. The league also agreed to change its name from National to simply Division 1. For the 1934\u201335 season, the league organised a legitimate promotion and relegation system bringing the total tally of clubs in the first division to 16. The number remained until the 1938\u201339 season.\nBecause of World War II, football was suspended by the French government and the Ligue de Football Professionnel, although its member clubs continued playing in regional competitions. During the \"war championships\", as they are called, professionalism was abolished by the Vichy regime and clubs were forced to participate in regional leagues, designated as Zone Sud and Zone Nord. Due to its non-association with the two leagues, the LFP and FFF do not recognise the championships won by the clubs and thus 1939\u20131945 is non-existent in the two organisations' view. Following the conclusion of the war and the liberation of France, professional football returned to France. The first division increased its allotment of clubs to 18. This number remained until the 1965\u201366 season when the number was increased to 20. In 2002, the league changed its name from Division 1 to Ligue 1.\n\n\n== Format ==", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4111, "end_char_idx": 6446, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56c63624-f75e-4d55-994b-c34d295844f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "56c63624-f75e-4d55-994b-c34d295844f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Ligue 1.txt", "file_name": "Ligue 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d5c188ac-6407-4424-8fe6-83cd67dab4f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Ligue 1.txt", "file_name": "Ligue 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "b16fd4e1db4250ba16b1fbc85e364576ca4fa5d813831095313f650fce26b03c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6915a8c8-8de6-493c-b1ec-755f7279865a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Ligue 1.txt", "file_name": "Ligue 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "65270d7e65f3f8fa482805436d6a5e960966f6fa7af736d2804e55fed0ddcfa9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "db1d41b2-d575-4173-bdc8-7df13dc1b45d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5978c7a0d6b098717375a989da7d13f11d3c6fc6910f67f85f8ed69ed5a0c345", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Format ==\n\n\n== Competition format ==\nThere are 18 clubs in Ligue 1. During the course of a season, usually from August to May, each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 34 games, though special circumstances may allow a club to host matches at other venues such as when Lille hosted Lyon at the Stade de France in 2007 and 2008. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. For the 2015\u201316 season only, two teams were to be relegated and only two teams from Ligue 2 were to be promoted, but this decision was overturned and three teams were relegated and three teams promoted. \nThus, it was the 2016\u201317 season which saw the return of a relegation play-off between the 18th-placed Ligue 1 team and the third-placed team in the Ligue 2 on a two-legged confrontation, with the Ligue 2 team hosting the first game.\nPreviously, the league utilised a different promotion and relegation format. Prior to 1995, the league's format was direct relegation of the bottom two teams and a play-off between the third-last first-division team and the winner of the second-division play-offs, similar to the Dutch Eredivisie, and the German Bundesliga. The league has also experimented with a \"bonus\" rule. From 1973 to 1976, a rule rewarded teams scoring three or more goals in a game with one extra point, regardless of outcome, with the objective of encouraging offensive play. The experience was ultimately inconclusive. At the start of the 2006\u201307 season, the league introduced an Attacking Play Table to encourage the scoring of more goals in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2. The LFP, with the help of the former manager Michel Hidalgo introduced the idea to reward those teams who score the most goals. The table was similar to the previous idea, but was independent from the official league table and clubs were only rewarded with monetary bonuses.\nIn June 2021, the LFP voted overwhelmingly at its general assembly to contract Ligue 1 back to 18 clubs for the 2023\u201324 season by relegating four to, and promoting two from, Ligue 2 after 2022\u201323.\n\n\n=== European qualification ===\nAs of the 2023\u201324 season, as determined by the UEFA coefficient, the top four teams in Ligue 1 qualify for the Champions League, with the top three proceeding directly to the group phase. The fourth-placed team enters in the third qualifying round. The fifth-placed team qualifies for the UEFA Europa League, the sixth for UEFA Conference League. The last Europa League place is determined through the country's domestic cup competition, the Coupe de France. If the cup winner qualifies for Europe through their league position, the seventh-placed team in Ligue 1 will qualify for the Conference League. If France is among the top two nations that earned the most coefficient points from a single season, an additional Champions League group phase spot will be awarded to the team in fourth place; as such the Champions League third qualifying round spot and all spots below will be pushed back one position.\n\n\n== Clubs ==\n\nA total of 74 clubs have played in Ligue 1 from its foundation in the 1932\u201333 season to the start of the 2024\u201325 season. Currently, Marseille, Montpellier, Nice and Rennes are the only founding members of the league to be playing in Ligue 1. Paris Saint-Germain is the only club to have not suffered points relegation. They earned promotion to the first division for the 1974\u201375 season and have not faltered down since. Paris Saint-Germain was administratively relegated by the league following its split from Paris FC in 1972, but returned to the top flight two seasons later.\nInternationally, the most well-known Ligue 1 clubs include Marseille, Lyon, Monaco and Lille.\n\n\n=== Members for 2024\u201325 ===\nThe following 18 clubs are competing in the 2024\u201325 Ligue 1 season.\n\nAs of start of 2024\u201325 Ligue 1 season", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6434, "end_char_idx": 10804, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db1d41b2-d575-4173-bdc8-7df13dc1b45d": {"__data__": {"id_": "db1d41b2-d575-4173-bdc8-7df13dc1b45d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Ligue 1.txt", "file_name": "Ligue 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d5c188ac-6407-4424-8fe6-83cd67dab4f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Ligue 1.txt", "file_name": "Ligue 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "b16fd4e1db4250ba16b1fbc85e364576ca4fa5d813831095313f650fce26b03c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "56c63624-f75e-4d55-994b-c34d295844f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Ligue 1.txt", "file_name": "Ligue 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "efb1b6b3a69db1b6fd3449b8dcd0181c4ea9df640f5d41b4a74ba4009d9c87db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6336446-7d63-4f39-bcaf-42d3028dff6c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "03a527e10ddcf46b6ca052f706b393770e3bff72953b9677f9adda94316616a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Members for 2024\u201325 ===\nThe following 18 clubs are competing in the 2024\u201325 Ligue 1 season.\n\nAs of start of 2024\u201325 Ligue 1 season\n\n\n== Finances ==\nLigue 1 clubs' finances and budgets are managed by the DNCG (Direction Nationale du Contr\u00f4le de Gestion), an organisation responsible for monitoring the accounts of professional association football clubs in France. It was founded in 1984 and is an administrative directorate of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP). The mission of the DNCG is to oversee all financial operations of the 44 member clubs of the LFP, develop the resources of professional clubs, apply sanctions to those clubs breaking the rules of operation, defend the morals and interests of French football in general.\nFollowing a report by the DNCG, it was determined that the combined budget of Ligue 1 clubs was \u20ac910 million for the 2005\u201306 season, a 39% increase from the 2002\u201303 season. The prominent reason for the rise was mainly associated with the television rights deal the league regularly signs. Excluding Paris Saint-Germain, many of the top division clubs are extremely healthy with clubs such as Auxerre, Bordeaux, Lille and Lyon being referred to as \"managed to perfection\". However, recently the DNCG has encouraged clubs to concentrate on limiting their \"skyrocketing wage bills and the magnitude of their debts\" after it was discovered that the LFP clubs accounts as a whole were in the red for the third consecutive season (2008\u20132011) with an estimated deficit of \u20ac130 million. In 2012, the LFP announced that the clubs deficit had been cut in half from \u20ac130 million to \u20ac65 million. Ligue 1 ranks fifth in terms of revenue brought in by clubs with the league bringing in \u00a30.6 billion for the 2006\u201307 season trailing England, Italy, Spain and Germany.\nIn terms of world football, clubs Lyon and Marseille are among the richest football clubs in the world and regularly feature in the Deloitte Football Money League ranking of football clubs by revenue generated from football operations. In the list compiled in the 2008\u201309 season, Lyon ranked 13th among clubs generating approximately \u20ac139.6 million, while Marseille were right behind them in 14th position generating \u20ac133.2 million.\nIn 2016, just Paris Saint-Germain was in the top 30 of the Deloitte Football Money League (ranked 4). From 2017 to 2020, Paris Saint-Germain (ranked between five and seven) and Lyon (ranked between 17 and 28) were part of the top 30.\n\n\n== Performance by club ==\n\nBold indicates clubs playing in 2024\u201325 Ligue 1.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Records ==\n\n\n=== Appearances ===\n\nNotes\n\nItalics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in Ligue 1.\n\n\n=== Goalscorers ===\n\nNotes\n\nItalics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in Ligue 1.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 10670, "end_char_idx": 13507, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6336446-7d63-4f39-bcaf-42d3028dff6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6336446-7d63-4f39-bcaf-42d3028dff6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Ligue 1.txt", "file_name": "Ligue 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d5c188ac-6407-4424-8fe6-83cd67dab4f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Ligue 1.txt", "file_name": "Ligue 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "b16fd4e1db4250ba16b1fbc85e364576ca4fa5d813831095313f650fce26b03c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "db1d41b2-d575-4173-bdc8-7df13dc1b45d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Ligue 1.txt", "file_name": "Ligue 1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 17468, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "4ccd35221a71bf1aa0a3aeec8cac0e4d035e4ac9b01fe6d4a28fc9275153e076", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Performance by club ==\n\nBold indicates clubs playing in 2024\u201325 Ligue 1.\n\nNotes\n\n\n== Records ==\n\n\n=== Appearances ===\n\nNotes\n\nItalics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in Ligue 1.\n\n\n=== Goalscorers ===\n\nNotes\n\nItalics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in Ligue 1.\n\n\n== Media coverage ==\nThe LFP formerly had rights agreements with the premium channels Canal+ and beIN Sports.
