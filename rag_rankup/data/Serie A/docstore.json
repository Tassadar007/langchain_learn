The winners are awarded the Coppa Campioni d'Italia trophy and the scudetto, a decoration that they wear on the jersey the season after the victory. It has been operating as a round-robin tournament for over ninety years since the 1929\u201330 season. It had been organized by the Direttorio Divisioni Superiori until 1943, the Lega Calcio until 2010, and the Lega Serie A ever since. Serie A is regarded as one of the best football leagues in the world and it is often depicted as the most tactical and defensively sound national league. Serie A was ranked the world's best national league in 2023 by IFFHS, and is ranked second among European leagues according to UEFA's league coefficient \u2013 behind the Premier League, and ahead of La Liga, Bundesliga and Ligue 1 \u2013 which is based on the performance of Italian clubs in the Champions League and the Europa League during the previous five years. Serie A led the UEFA ranking from 1986 to 1988 and from 1990 to 1999.\nIn its current format, the Italian Football Championship was revised from having regional and interregional rounds, to a single-tier league from the 1929\u201330 season onwards. The championship titles won before 1929 are officially recognised by FIGC with the same weighting as titles that were subsequently awarded. Similarly, the 1945\u201346 season, when the round-robin was suspended and the league was played over two geographical groups due to the ravages of World War II, is not statistically considered, even if its title is fully official.\nThe league hosts three of the world's most famous clubs as Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan, all founding members of the G-14, a group which represented the largest and most prestigious European football clubs from 2000 to 2008, with the first two also being founding members of its successive organisation, European Club Association (ECA). More players have won the Ballon d'Or award while playing at a Serie A club than any league in the world other than Spain's La Liga. Juventus, Italy's most successful club of the 20th century and the most winning Italian team, is tied for sixth in Europe and twelfth in the world with the most official international titles with eleven. Prior the first Europa Conference League final in 2022, it was also the only one in the world to have won all the historical five official confederation competitions, an achievement reached after its triumph in the 1985 Intercontinental Cup and revalidated after winning a sixth tournament, the UEFA Intertoto Cup, fourteen years later. Milan is joint third club overall for official international titles won with nineteen. Inter, following their achievements in the 2009\u201310 season, became the first Italian team to have achieved a seasonal treble. It is also the team to have competed uninterruptedly for the most time in the top flight of Italian football, having seen its debut in 1909. All these clubs, along with Lazio, Fiorentina, Roma and Napoli, are known as the \"seven sisters\" (sette sorelle) of Italian football.\nSerie A is one of the most storied football leagues in the world. Of the 100 greatest footballers in history chosen by FourFourTwo in 2017, 42 players have played in Serie A, more than any other league in the world. Juventus is the team that has produced the most World Cup champions (27), with Inter (20), Roma (16) and Milan (10), being respectively third, fourth and ninth in that ranking.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3666, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "802dee5e-44ef-4a59-b7b6-aaf7c5c83cdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "802dee5e-44ef-4a59-b7b6-aaf7c5c83cdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Serie A.txt", "file_name": "Serie A.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19909, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc519bb0-9c23-4238-b715-7cdd101b4ec0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Serie A.txt", "file_name": "Serie A.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19909, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "fc45dc4cea15aa9d15550fe21c0a48a95d9a35c668da442a1c2943d68d2fb07d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7d77fb7-cf14-4a8f-aa5d-7a56c3254a5e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Serie A.txt", "file_name": "Serie A.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19909, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "7805732e00c41b1ccad19493a78681e05ea54c95f30820cd40fa18485540499c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "89de17ca-b566-43b7-b6ef-afe46a9e9341", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d39df727620d35d47a19bb7c63235187fe33b2afccdd6c79f228cb2fd038ae33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== History ==\nSerie A, as it is structured today, began during the 1929\u201330 season. From 1898 to 1922, the competition was organised into regional groups. Because of ever growing teams attending regional championships, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) split the CCI (Italian Football Confederation) in 1921, which founded in Milan the Lega Nord (Northern Football League), ancestor of present-day Lega Serie A. When CCI teams rejoined the FIGC created two interregional divisions renaming Categories into Divisions and splitting FIGC sections into two north\u2013south leagues. In 1926, due to internal crises and fascist pressures, the FIGC changed internal settings, adding southern teams to the national division, ultimately leading to the 1929\u201330 final settlement.\nThe Serie A Championship title is often referred to as the scudetto (\"small shield\") because since the 1923\u201324 season, the winning team will bear a small coat of arms with the Italian tricolour on their strip in the following season. The most successful club is Juventus with 36 championships, followed by Inter Milan with 20 championships and AC Milan with 19 championships. From the 2004\u201305 season onwards, an actual trophy was awarded to club on the pitch after the last turn of the championship. The trophy, called the Coppa Campioni d'Italia, has officially been used since the 1960\u201361 season, but between 1961 and 2004 was consigned to the winning clubs at the head office of the Lega Nazionale Professionisti.\nIn April 2009, Serie A announced a split from Serie B. Nineteen of the twenty clubs voted in favour of the move in an argument over television rights; the relegation-threatened Lecce had voted against the decision. Maurizio Beretta, the former head of Italy's employers' association, became president of the new league.\nIn April 2016, it was announced that Serie A was selected by the International Football Association Board to test video replays, which were initially private for the 2016\u201317 season, allowing them to become a live pilot phase, with replay assistance implemented in the 2017\u201318 season. On the decision, FIGC President Carlo Tavecchio said: \"We were among the first supporters of using technology on the pitch and we believe we have everything required to offer our contribution to this important experiment.\"\nSerie A will continue the 20 club format after sixteen clubs voted against reducing the division to 18 teams in February 2024.\n\n\n== Format ==\nFor most of Serie A's history, there were 16 or 18 clubs competing at the top level. Since 2004\u201305, however, there have been 20 clubs in total. One season (1947\u201348) was played with 21 teams for political reasons, following post-war tensions with Yugoslavia. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league's history:\n\n18 clubs: 1929\u20131934\n16 clubs: 1934\u20131943\n20 clubs: 1946\u20131947\n21 clubs: 1947\u20131948\n20 clubs: 1948\u20131952\n18 clubs: 1952\u20131967\n16 clubs: 1967\u20131988\n18 clubs: 1988\u20132004\n20 clubs: 2004\u2013present\n\nDuring the season, which runs from August to May, each club plays each of the other teams twice; once at home and once away, totalling 38 games for each team by the end of the season. Thus, in Italian football a true round-robin format is used. In the first half of the season, called the andata, each team plays once against each league opponent, for a total of 19 games. In the second half of the season, called the ritorno, the teams play another 19 games, once more against each opponent, in which home and away matches are reversed. The two halves of the season had exactly the same order of fixtures until the 2021\u201322 season, when an asymmetrical calendar was introduced, following the format of the English, Spanish and French leagues. Since the 1994\u201395 season, teams are awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. Prior to this, teams were awarded two points for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss. The three lowest-placed teams at the end of the season are relegated to Serie B, and three Serie B teams are promoted to replace them for the next season.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3669, "end_char_idx": 7772, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89de17ca-b566-43b7-b6ef-afe46a9e9341": {"__data__": {"id_": "89de17ca-b566-43b7-b6ef-afe46a9e9341", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Serie A.txt", "file_name": "Serie A.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19909, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc519bb0-9c23-4238-b715-7cdd101b4ec0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Serie A.txt", "file_name": "Serie A.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19909, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "fc45dc4cea15aa9d15550fe21c0a48a95d9a35c668da442a1c2943d68d2fb07d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "802dee5e-44ef-4a59-b7b6-aaf7c5c83cdb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Serie A.txt", "file_name": "Serie A.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19909, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "774105ece445a6030ff301f93048924ef868d4dd0cf5a2d30e9c9b072a0a5073", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae1f1e98-5acc-4836-8360-65401950f7ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff80caddf138504a30b821407ce516b89502ac39d31afe5d78ec5d37f1b13e6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== European qualification ===\nAs of 2022, Serie A is ranked as the fourth-best league by UEFA coefficient, therefore the top four teams in the Serie A qualify straight to the UEFA Champions League group stage. The team finishing fifth, along with the Coppa Italia winner (if the Coppa Italia winner finishes outside the top five) or the team finishing sixth (if the Coppa Italia winner finishes inside the top five), qualify for the UEFA Europa League group stage. The sixth or the seventh ranked club, depending on the Coppa Italia winner's league performance, joins the final qualification round of the UEFA Europa Conference League.\n\n\n=== Tiebreaking ===\n\nIf after all 38 games, there are two teams tied on points for first place or for 17th, the last safety spot, the team that wins the scudetto or stays up at 17th is decided by a single-legged play-off game of 90 minutes and penalties (no extra time), to be held at a neutral venue, with the host team decided by the tiebreakers listed below. If at least three teams are tied for one of those spots, then the two teams to play in the match is decided by a mini table between the teams involved using the tiebreakers below. The deciding tie-breakers for any ties on all other positions are as follows:\n\nHead-to-head points\nGoal difference of head-to-head games\nGoal difference overall\nHigher number of goals scored\nPlay-off game at a neutral venue if relevant to decide European qualification or relegation; otherwise by coin flip\nBetween 2006\u201307 and 2021\u201322, the tiebreakers currently used for all places to decide the scudetto winner if necessary, though this was never needed. Before 2005\u201306, a play-off would immediately be used if teams were tied for first place, a European qualification spot, or a relegation spot. In some past years, the playoff was a single game at a neutral site while in others it was a two-legged tie decided by aggregate score. A playoff game has never been needed since the tiebreaking format changed.\nThe only time a playoff was used to decide the champion occurred in the 1963\u201364 season when Bologna and Inter both finished on 54 points. Bologna won the playoff 2\u20130 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome to win the scudetto. Playoff games were used on multiple occasions to decide European competition qualifications (most recently in 1999\u20132000) and relegation (most recently in 2022\u201323).\n\n\n== Clubs ==\n\nBefore 1929, many clubs competed in the top level of Italian football as the earlier rounds were competed up to 1922 on a regional basis then interregional up to 1929.

Notable foreign players to play in Serie A during this era included Irish international Liam Brady, England internationals Paul Gascoigne and David Platt, France's Michel Platini and Laurent Blanc, Lothar Matth\u00e4us and J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann from Germany, Dutchmen Ruud Gullit and Dennis Bergkamp, and Argentina's Diego Maradona.\nIn the middle of the 2000\u201301 season, the old quota system, which limited each team to having no more than five non-EU players and using no more than three in each match, was abolished. Concurrent with the abolishment of the quota, the FIGC had investigated footballers that used fake passports. Alberto and Warley, Alejandro Da Silva and Jorginho Paulista of Udinese; F\u00e1bio J\u00fanior and Gustavo Bartelt of Roma; Dida of Milan; \u00c1lvaro Recoba of Inter; Thomas Job, Francis Z\u00e9, Jean Ondoa of Sampdoria; and Jeda and Dede of Vicenza were all banned in July 2001 for lengths ranging from six months to one year. However, most of the bans were subsequently reduced.\nAt the start of the 2003\u201304 season, a quota was imposed on each of the clubs limiting the number of non-EU, non-EFTA and non-Swiss players who may be signed from abroad each season, following provisional measures introduced in the 2002\u201303 season, which allowed Serie A and B clubs to sign only one non-EU player in the 2002 summer transfer window.\nThe rule underwent minor changes in August 2004, June 2005, June 2006, and June 2007.\nThe number of non-EU players was reduced from 265 in 2002\u201303 season to 166 in 2006\u201307 season. This reduction also included players who received EU status after their respective countries joined the EU (see 2004 and 2007 enlargement), which made players such as Adrian Mutu, Valeri Bojinov, Marek Jankulovski and Marius Stankevi\u010dius EU players.\nThe quota system changed again at the beginning of the 2008\u201309 season: three quotas were awarded to clubs that do not have non-EU players in their squad (previously only newly promoted clubs could have three quotas); clubs that had one non-EU player had two quotas. Those clubs that had two non-EU players were awarded one quota and one conditional quota, which was awarded after: 1) Transferred 1 non-EU player abroad, or 2) Release 1 non-EU player as free agent, or 3) A non-EU player received EU nationality. Clubs with three or more non-EU players had two conditional quotas, but releasing two non-EU players as free agent only gave one quota instead of two. Serie B and Lega Pro clubs could not sign non-EU players from abroad, except those that followed a club promoted from Serie D.\nOn 2 July 2010, the above conditional quota was reduced back to one, though if a team did not have any non-EU players, that team could still sign up to three non-EU players. In 2011 the signing quota reverted to two.\nLarge clubs with many foreigners usually borrow quotas from other clubs that have few foreigners or no foreigners in order to sign more non-EU players. For example, Adrian Mutu joined Juventus via Livorno in 2005, as at the time Romania was not a member of the EU. Other examples include J\u00falio C\u00e9sar, Victor Obinna and Maxwell, who joined Inter from Chievo (first two) and Empoli, respectively.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 13335, "end_char_idx": 17732, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba639da1-5b67-42a5-885f-188af765b772": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba639da1-5b67-42a5-885f-188af765b772", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Serie A.txt", "file_name": "Serie A.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19909, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc519bb0-9c23-4238-b715-7cdd101b4ec0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Serie A.txt", "file_name": "Serie A.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19909, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "fc45dc4cea15aa9d15550fe21c0a48a95d9a35c668da442a1c2943d68d2fb07d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ea97e1f-5b74-4532-b822-ffc2ce325dba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/Serie A.txt", "file_name": "Serie A.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 19909, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "21a439ad7f85276d3a004760726c5574716afc0fa9706793dd6385b240315351", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== Homegrown players ===\nSerie A also imposed Homegrown players rule, a modification of Homegrown Player Rule (UEFA).
