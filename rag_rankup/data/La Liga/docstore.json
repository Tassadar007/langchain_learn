It is controlled by the Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol Profesional and is contested by 20 teams over a 38-matchday period.\nSince its inception, 62 teams have competed in La Liga. Nine teams have been crowned champions, with Barcelona winning the inaugural La Liga and Real Madrid winning the title a record 36 times. Real Madrid are also the most recent winners, having won the 2023\u201324 edition. During the 1940s Valencia, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Barcelona emerged as the strongest clubs, winning several titles. Real Madrid and Barcelona dominated the championship in the 1950s, each winning four La Liga titles during the decade. During the 1960s and 1970s, Real Madrid dominated La Liga, winning fourteen titles, with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid winning four. During the 1980s and 1990s Real Madrid were prominent in La Liga, but the Basque clubs of Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad had their share of success, each winning two Liga titles. From the 1990s onward, Barcelona have dominated La Liga, winning seventeen titles to date. Although Real Madrid has been prominent, winning eleven titles, La Liga has also seen other champions, including Valencia and Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a.\nAccording to UEFA's league coefficient rankings, La Liga was the top league in Europe in each of the seven years from 2013 to 2019 (calculated using accumulated figures from five preceding seasons) and led Europe for 22 of the 60 ranked years up to 2019, more than any other country. It also produced the continent's top-rated club more times (22) than any other league in that period, more than double that of second-placed Serie A (Italy), including the top club in 10 of the 11 seasons between 2009 and 2019; each of these pinnacles was achieved by either Barcelona or Real Madrid. La Liga clubs have won the most UEFA Champions League (20), UEFA Europa League (14), UEFA Super Cup (16) and FIFA Club World Cup (8) titles, and its players have accumulated the highest number of Ballon d'Or awards (24), The Best FIFA Men's Player awards (19) and UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards (12).\nLa Liga is one of the most popular professional sports leagues globally, with an average attendance of 26,933 for league matches in the 2018\u201319 season. This is the eighth-highest of any domestic professional sports league in the world and the third-highest of any professional association football league in the world, behind fellow big five leagues Bundesliga and Premier League, and above Serie A and Ligue 1. La Liga is also the seventh wealthiest professional sports league in the world by revenue, after the NFL, MLB, the NBA, the Premier League, the NHL, and the Bundesliga.\nFrom 2008 to 2016, it was sponsored by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and known as Liga BBVA. Then, from 2016 to 2023, it was sponsored by Banco Santander and known as LaLiga Santander. Since 2023, it has been sponsored by Electronic Arts and is known as LaLiga EA Sports.\n\n\n== Competition format ==\nThe competition format follows the usual double round-robin format. During the course of a season, which lasts from August to May, each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for 38 matches. Teams receive three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, with the highest-ranked club crowned champion at the end of the season.\n\n\n=== Promotion and relegation ===\nA system of promotion and relegation exists between the Primera Divisi\u00f3n and the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. The three lowest placed teams in La Liga are relegated to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, and the top two teams from the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n promoted to La Liga, with an additional club promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs.

These are:\nyellow card, 1 point\ndoubled yellow card/ejection, 2 points\ndirect red card, 3 points\nsuspension or disqualification of coach, executive or other club personnel (outside referees' decisions), 5 points\nmisconduct of the supporters: mild 5 points, serious 6 points, very serious 7 points\nstadium closure, 10 points\nif the Competition Committee removes a penalty, the points are also removed\nIf the tie is still not broken, it will be resolved with a tie-break match in a neutral stadium.\n\n\n=== Qualification for European competitions ===\n\n\n==== Current criteria ====\nThe top four teams in La Liga qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League group stage. The winners of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League also qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League group stage. \nThe fifth place team in La Liga and the winner of the Copa del Rey also qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Europa League group stage. However, if the winner also finished in the top five places in La Liga, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in La Liga. Furthermore, the sixth place (or seventh if sixth already qualifies due to the Copa del Rey) team qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Conference League play-off round.\nThe number of places allocated to Spanish clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position a country holds in the UEFA country coefficients, which are calculated based upon the performance of teams in UEFA competitions in the previous five years.

In 1935, Real Betis, then known as Betis Balompi\u00e9, won their only title to date. Primera Divisi\u00f3n was suspended during the Spanish Civil War.\nIn 1937, the teams in the Republican area of Spain, with the notable exception of the two Madrid clubs, competed in the Mediterranean League and Barcelona emerged as champions. Seventy years later, on 28 September 2007, Barcelona requested the Royal Spanish Football Federation (Spanish acronym RFEF) to recognise that title as a Liga title.

Atl\u00e9tico were only awarded a place during the 1939\u201340 season as a replacement for Real Oviedo, whose ground had been damaged during the war. The club subsequently won its first Liga title and retained it in 1941. While other clubs lost players to exile, execution, and as casualties of the war, the Atl\u00e9tico team was reinforced by a merger. The young, pre-war squad of Valencia had also remained intact and in the post-war years matured into champions, gaining three Liga titles in 1942, 1944, and 1947. They were also runners-up in 1948 and 1949.\nAthletic Bilbao was one of the clubs most affected by the war, since many of its players (sympathizers of the Republican faction) went into exile in Latin America and very few returned. But thanks to a search for young talents, they managed to form the well-known Second historic squad made up of Rafael Iriondo, Venancio P\u00e9rez, Jos\u00e9 Luis Panizo, Agust\u00edn Ga\u00ednza and the mythical scorer Telmo Zarra (Spanish top scorer in La Liga history, among other records). They won a La Liga and Copa del General\u00edsimo double in 1943 and won the Cup again in 1944, 1945 and 1950, in addition to an Copa Eva Duarte (official predecessor of the Supercopa). Sevilla also enjoyed a brief golden era, finishing as runners-up in 1940 and 1942 before winning their only title to date in 1946.\nMeanwhile, on the other side of Spain, Barcelona began to emerge as a force under the legendary Josep Samitier. A Spanish footballer for both Barcelona and Real Madrid, Samitier cemented his legacy with Barcelona. During his playing career with Barcelona he scored 133 goals, won the inaugural La Liga title and five Copa Del Rey. In 1944, Samitier returned to Barcelona as a coach and guided them in winning their second La Liga title in 1945. Under Samitier and legendary players C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez, Josep Escol\u00e0, Estanislau Basora and Mariano Gonzalvo, Barcelona dominated La Liga in the late 1940s, winning back to back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949.

In 1959, Barcelona also won another double of La Liga / Copa Del Rey, conquering three doubles in the 1950s.\nThe 1950s also saw the beginning of the Real Madrid dominance. During the 1930s through the 1950s there were strict limits imposed on foreign players. In most cases, clubs could have only three foreign players in their squads, meaning that at least eight local players had to play in every game. During the 1950s, however, these rules were circumvented by Real Madrid who naturalised Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano and Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s. Di St\u00e9fano, Pusk\u00e1s, Raymond Kopa and Francisco Gento formed the nucleus of the Real Madrid team that dominated the second half of the 1950s. Real Madrid won their third La Liga in 1954 \u2014 their first since 1933 \u2014 and retained their title in 1955. In 1956, Athletic Bilbao won their sixth La Liga title, but Real Madrid won La Liga again in 1957 and 1958. \nAll in all, Barcelona and Real Madrid won four La Liga titles each in the 1950s, with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid winning two and Athletic Bilbao winning one during this decade.\n\n\n=== 1960s\u20131970s: Real Madrid superiority ===\nReal Madrid dominated La Liga between 1960 and 1980, being crowned champions 14 times. Real Madrid won five consecutive La Liga titles (1961 to 1965) as well as winning three doubles between 1960 and 1980. During the 1960s and 1970s, only Atl\u00e9tico Madrid offered Real Madrid any serious challenge. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid were crowned La Liga champions four times in 1966, 1970, 1973, and 1977. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid also finished second place in 1961, 1963, and 1965. In 1971, Valencia won their fourth La Liga title in 1971 under Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, and the Johan Cruyff-inspired Barcelona won their ninth La Liga in 1974.\n\n\n=== 1980s: Real Madrid dominate but the Basque Clubs disrupt their monopoly ===\nReal Madrid's monopoly in La Liga was interrupted significantly in the 1980s. Although Real Madrid won another five consecutive La Liga titles (1986 to 1990) under the brilliance of Emilio Butrague\u00f1o and Hugo S\u00e1nchez, the Basque clubs of Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao also dominated the 1980s. Real Sociedad won their first La Liga titles in 1981 and 1982; Luis Arconada, Roberto L\u00f3pez Ufarte and Txiki Begiristain stood out from this team. Later, Athletic Bilbao also managed to win two consecutive La Liga titles in 1983 and 1984, also achieving their fifth La Liga and Copa del Rey double in 1984; The stars Andoni Zubizarreta, Santi Urkiaga, Andoni Goikoetxea, Dani, Manuel Sarabia and Estanislao Argote made this success possible. For its part, Barcelona won their tenth La Liga title in 1985 under coach Terry Venables, their first La Liga win since 1974.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 10917, "end_char_idx": 14610, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bd9fea9-959a-491f-9e73-c6c9b043e8af": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bd9fea9-959a-491f-9e73-c6c9b043e8af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/La Liga.txt", "file_name": "La Liga.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 27106, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "19619234-fa5b-4f5f-8b1a-84ce6d607d0c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/La Liga.txt", "file_name": "La Liga.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 27106, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "33727c3fa8b3f2216c2e1a7d65d56fcfe33da4d31680c53063e730dabf23cdc6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f314a59-9789-497c-a957-a3981d5d2cc4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/La Liga.txt", "file_name": "La Liga.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 27106, "creation_date": "2024-09-08", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-08"}, "hash": "a655df2fbf4e31e42fe674bb5e0114261e57aa5f525b083e6ede26a3920fded3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5495a98c-48b2-4997-8dff-7bdbb8e56b17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b715f0367af8647f67bde116533df32ab2d75e012ef34dfe6199b958b6d97b0e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "=== 1990s: Barcelona's Dream Team ===\n\nJohan Cruyff returned to Barcelona as manager in 1988, and assembled the legendary Dream Team. When Cruyff took control of his Barcelona side, they had won only two La Liga titles in the past 20 years. Cruyff decided to build a team composed of international stars and La Masia graduates in order to restore Barcelona to their former glory days. This team was formed by international stars Romario, Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman. Cruyff's Dream Team also consisted of La Masia graduates Pep Guardiola, Albert Ferrer and Guillermo Amor, as well as Basque Andoni Zubizarreta.\nJohan Cruyff changed the way modern football was played, and incorporated the principles of Total Football into this team. The success of possession-based football was revolutionary, and Cruyff's team won their first European Cup in 1992 and four consecutive La Liga titles between 1991 and 1994. In total, Cruyff won eleven trophies in eight years, making him the most successful manager in Barcelona's history, until the record was broken by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Pep Guardiola two decades later.\nBarcelona's run ended with Real Madrid winning La Liga in 1995. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid won their ninth La Liga title in 1996, as well as their only Liga/Copa Del Rey double, before Real Madrid added another league title to their cabinet in 1997. After the success of Cruyff, another Dutchman \u2013 Ajax manager, Louis van Gaal \u2013 arrived at the Camp Nou, and with the talents of Lu\u00eds Figo, Luis Enrique, and Rivaldo, Barcelona won the La Liga title in 1998 and 1999, including their fourth double of Liga and Copa Del Rey in 1998. All in all, Barcelona won six La Liga titles in the 1990s.\n\n\n=== 2000s: Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia's re-emergence ===\n\nThe 21st century continued the success Barcelona had in the 1990s under Johan Cruyff, dominating La Liga. Although Real Madrid had been prominent, Barcelona created a hegemony in Spain not seen since the Real Madrid of the 1960s\u201370s. Since the start of the new century, Barcelona won ten La Ligas, including two trebles and four doubles. This new century however has also seen new challengers being crowned champions. Between 1999\u20132000 and 2004, Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a finished in the top three on five occasions, a better record than either Real Madrid or Barcelona, and in 2000, under Javier Irureta, Deportivo became the ninth team to be crowned champions. Valencia were one of the strongest teams in Europe in the early to mid 2000s; they were crowned La Liga champions in 2002 and 2004 under Rafael Ben\u00edtez, whilst also being runners-up in the UEFA Champions League in 2000 and 2001 under Hector Cuper and winning the UEFA Cup in 2004 and the Copa del Rey in 1999.\nReal Madrid won their first Liga titles of the century in 2001 and 2003. With world-class players like Ra\u00fal, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Real Madrid won back-to-back La Liga titles in 2006\u201307 and 2007\u201308. Barcelona won their first title of the new century after Real Madrid and Valencia had shared the last four titles under the brilliance of Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto'o in the 2004\u201305 season.

Madrid won their 32nd La Liga title with a record 100 points, a record 121 goals scored and a record +89 goal difference. The following year, in the 2012\u201313 season, Barcelona won yet another La Liga title under coach Tito Vilanova, replicating the 100 points record Real Madrid achieved the previous year. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, under the management of Diego Simeone, won their tenth La Liga title in 2013\u201314, their first since 1996. They became the first team since Valencia in 2004 to win La Liga and break Barcelona and Real Madrid's dominion over the league. In the 2014\u201315 season, under the trio of Messi, Neymar, and Suarez nicknamed 'MSN', Barcelona made history by becoming the first team to achieve a second Treble, and winning a sixth Liga/Copa Del Rey double. Barcelona continued their dominance, and in the 2015\u201316 season they won a back-to-back Liga/Copa Del Rey double, something that had not been achieved since the 1950s. Real Madrid brought back the La Liga title under the management of Zinedine Zidane in 2016\u201317, but Barcelona won the title again in the 2017\u201318 season, as well as winning their eighth double, for seven La Liga titles in ten years. Barcelona retained the title yet again and won their 26th La Liga title in the 2018\u201319 season, for eight La Liga titles in eleven years.
