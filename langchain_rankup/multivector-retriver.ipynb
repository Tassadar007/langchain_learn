Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. \\n\\nWe will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. \\n\\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.  \\n\\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. \\n\\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \\n\\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \\n\\nWe’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \\n\\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \\n\\nAnd we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \\n\\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \\n\\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \\n\\nAnd on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \\n\\nEven if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \\n\\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \\n\\nIf necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \\n\\nAnd, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed. \\n\\nI cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.  \\n\\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. \\n\\nIt’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \\n\\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \\n\\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \\n\\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \\n\\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \\n\\nOf course, continuing this costs money. \\n\\nI will soon send Congress a request. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \\n\\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \\n\\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \\n\\nAnd we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. \\n\\nI’ve worked on these issues a long time. \\n\\nI know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. \\n\\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \\n\\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \\n\\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \\n\\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \\n\\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \\n\\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \\n\\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \\n\\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \\n\\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \\n\\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \\n\\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \\n\\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. \\n\\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \\n\\nWe cannot let this happen. \\n\\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \\n\\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \\n\\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.')"

       "[Document(metadata={'source': './data/state_of_the_union.txt'}, page_content='One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \\n\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. \\n\\nA former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \\n\\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \\n\\nWe can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \\n\\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \\n\\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. \\n\\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. \\n\\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours. \\n\\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. \\n\\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite. \\n\\nIt’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do. \\n\\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \\n\\nLet’s get it done once and for all. \\n\\nAdvancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. \\n\\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before. \\n\\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America. \\n\\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. \\n\\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. \\n\\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \\n\\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \\n\\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  \\n\\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic. \\n\\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.  \\n\\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. \\n\\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. \\n\\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \\n\\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \\n\\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. \\n\\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. \\n\\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children. \\n\\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care. \\n\\nThird, support our veterans. \\n\\nVeterans are the best of us. \\n\\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. \\n\\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.  \\n\\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers. \\n\\nOne was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more. \\n\\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same. \\n\\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness. \\n\\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin. \\n\\nI know. \\n\\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden. \\n\\nWe don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops. \\n\\nBut I’m committed to finding out everything we can. \\n\\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio. \\n\\nThe widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.  \\n\\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq. \\n\\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields. \\n\\nHeath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter. \\n\\nBut cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body. \\n\\nDanielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end. \\n\\nHe didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she. \\n\\nThrough her pain she found purpose to demand we do better. \\n\\nTonight, Danielle—we are. \\n\\nThe VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits. \\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers. \\n\\nI’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve. \\n\\nAnd fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it. \\n\\nThis is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you. \\n\\nCancer is the #2 cause of death in America–second only to heart disease. \\n\\nLast month, I announced our plan to supercharge  \\nthe Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago. \\n\\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.  \\n\\nMore support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.  \\n\\nWe will meet the test. \\n\\nTo protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity. \\n\\nWe will save democracy. \\n\\nAs hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life. \\n\\nBecause I see the future that is within our grasp. \\n\\nBecause I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity. \\n\\nWe are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity. \\n\\nThe only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities. \\n\\nSo on this night, in our 245th year as a nation, I have come to report on the State of the Union. \\n\\nAnd my report is this: the State of the Union is strong—because you, the American people, are strong. \\n\\nWe are stronger today than we were a year ago. \\n\\nAnd we will be stronger a year from now than we are today. \\n\\nNow is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time. \\n\\nAnd we will, as one people. \\n\\nOne America. \\n\\nThe United States of America. \\n\\nMay God bless you all. May God protect our troops.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/state_of_the_union.txt'}, page_content='But in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back. \\n\\nWe’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.  \\n\\nAnd tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud. \\n\\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.  \\n\\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. \\n\\nLowering your costs also means demanding more competition. \\n\\nI’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. \\n\\nIt’s exploitation—and it drives up prices. \\n\\nWhen corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under. \\n\\nWe see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America. \\n\\nDuring the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits. \\n\\nTonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nAnd as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.  \\n\\nThat ends on my watch. \\n\\nMedicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect. \\n\\nWe’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees. \\n\\nLet’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.  \\n\\nRaise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty. \\n\\nLet’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges. \\n\\nAnd let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.  \\n\\nWhen we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America. \\n\\nFor more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation. \\n\\nAnd I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted. \\n\\nBut I also know this. \\n\\nBecause of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say  \\nwe are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.  \\n\\nWe’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.  \\n\\nJust a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines. \\n\\nUnder these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.   \\n\\nAnd based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks. \\n\\nThanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.  \\n\\nI know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19. \\n\\nWe will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard. \\n\\nHere are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.  \\n\\nFirst, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection. \\n\\nWe will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \\n\\nThe scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \\n\\nWe’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \\n\\nWe’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \\n\\nAnd we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \\n\\nIf you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \\n\\nWe’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \\n\\nAnd on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \\n\\nEven if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \\n\\nSecond – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \\n\\nIf necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \\n\\nAnd, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed. \\n\\nI cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.  \\n\\nThird – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. \\n\\nIt’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \\n\\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \\n\\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \\n\\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \\n\\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \\n\\nOf course, continuing this costs money. \\n\\nI will soon send Congress a request. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \\n\\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \\n\\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \\n\\nAnd we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. \\n\\nI’ve worked on these issues a long time. \\n\\nI know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. \\n\\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \\n\\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \\n\\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \\n\\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \\n\\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \\n\\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \\n\\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \\n\\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \\n\\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \\n\\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \\n\\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \\n\\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. \\n\\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \\n\\nWe cannot let this happen. \\n\\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \\n\\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \\n\\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/paul_graham_essay.txt'}, page_content='One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews, Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited advice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital. That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I remember his exact words very clearly. \"You know,\" he said, \"you should make sure Y Combinator isn\\'t the last cool thing you do.\"\\n\\nAt the time I didn\\'t understand what he meant, but gradually it dawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange advice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my attention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life\\'s work or I\\'d have to leave eventually. And it wasn\\'t, so I would.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to someone else.\\n\\nI asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn\\'t, so we decided we\\'d try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard. Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do that it couldn\\'t be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said yes, we\\'d let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.\\n\\nWhen we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors. But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided he\\'d take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose cancer had returned.\\n\\nShe died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was still hard when it did.\\n\\nI kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I\\'m interested in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)\\n\\nWhat should I do next? Rtm\\'s advice hadn\\'t included anything about that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided I\\'d paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting. I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was at least completely engaging. [18]\\n\\nI spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I\\'d never been able to work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I\\'d always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven\\'t painted since. So far anyway.\\n\\nI realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that\\'s not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it\\'s getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was some opportunity cost to screwing around.\\n\\nI started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over the next few months. I even wrote a couple that weren\\'t about startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.\\n\\nThe distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn\\'t originally intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language in itself, what\\'s the minimum set of predefined operators you need? The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered, is an answer to that question. [19]\\n\\nMcCarthy didn\\'t realize this Lisp could even be used to program computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell translated McCarthy\\'s interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn\\'t match. It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn\\'t understand why at the time.\\n\\nMcCarthy\\'s 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you\\'d want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren\\'t defined using McCarthy\\'s original axiomatic approach. That wouldn\\'t have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way — indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you\\'d have had to run it, and computers then weren\\'t powerful enough.\\n\\nNow they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy\\'s axiomatic approach till you\\'d defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy\\'s Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.\\n\\nI wrote this new Lisp, called Bel, in itself in Arc. That may sound like a contradiction, but it\\'s an indication of the sort of trickery I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast, but fast enough to test.\\n\\nI had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I\\'d never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. When you\\'re working on an interpreter written in itself, it\\'s hard to keep track of what\\'s happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.\\n\\nSo I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder than I\\'d ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for hours with some gruesome bug I\\'d check Twitter or HN and see someone asking \"Does Paul Graham still code?\"\\n\\nWorking on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still live there. So most of Bel was written in England.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy\\'s original Lisp, it\\'s a spec rather than an implementation, although like McCarthy\\'s Lisp it\\'s a spec expressed as code.\\n\\nNow that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics I\\'d had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also started to think about other things I could work on. How should I choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If this surprised me, who\\'d lived it, then I thought perhaps it would be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others to read, and this is the last sentence of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[1] My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers: time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem all the more exciting.\\n\\n[2] Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps like polluzione). It\\'s the everyday words that differ. So if you string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs, you can make a little Italian go a long way.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/state_of_the_union.txt'}, page_content='Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. \\n\\nIn this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight. \\n\\nLet each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. \\n\\nPlease rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nThroughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.   \\n\\nThey keep moving.   \\n\\nAnd the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.   \\n\\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. \\n\\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations. \\n\\nIt matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters. \\n\\nPutin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. \\n\\nHe rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. \\n\\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.  Here is what we did.   \\n\\nWe prepared extensively and carefully. \\n\\nWe spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin. \\n\\nI spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.  \\n\\nWe countered Russia’s lies with truth.   \\n\\nAnd now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable. \\n\\nAlong with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland. \\n\\nWe are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. \\n\\nTogether with our allies –we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. \\n\\nWe are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system.  \\n\\nPreventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.   \\n\\nWe are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.  \\n\\nTonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more. \\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.  \\n\\nWe are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains. \\n\\nAnd tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze –on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value. \\n\\nThe Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame. \\n\\nTogether with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance. \\n\\nWe are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine. \\n\\nAnd we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.  \\n\\nLet me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.  \\n\\nOur forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.  \\n\\nFor that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. \\n\\nAs I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.  \\n\\nAnd we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them.  \\n\\nPutin has unleashed violence and chaos.  But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. \\n\\nAnd a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay. \\n\\nWhen the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger. \\n\\nWhile it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake now everyone sees it clearly. \\n\\nWe see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for Ukraine.  \\n\\nIn the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security. \\n\\nThis is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nTo our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you. \\n\\nPutin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nHe will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world. \\n\\nWe meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced. \\n\\nThe pandemic has been punishing. \\n\\nAnd so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more. \\n\\nI understand. \\n\\nI remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it. \\n\\nThat’s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.  \\n\\nBecause people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did. \\n\\nFew pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis. \\n\\nIt fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans.  \\n\\nHelped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance. \\n\\nAnd as my Dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room. \\n\\nAnd unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people—and left no one behind. \\n\\nAnd it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs. \\n\\nIn fact—our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year  \\nthan ever before in the history of America. \\n\\nOur economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.  \\n\\nFor the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. \\n\\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. \\n\\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America. \\n\\nInvest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up  \\nand the middle out, not from the top down.  \\n\\nBecause we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well. \\n\\nAmerica used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth.')]"
